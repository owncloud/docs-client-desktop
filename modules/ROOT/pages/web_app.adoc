= Open Files with Office Web Apps
:toc: right

:description: When using Infinite Scale, you can open synced Office files locally using Office Web Apps.

== Introduction

{description} This is very beneficial for some reasons:

* if your local environment does not have an office package installed or available,
* collaborative working on the same document.

When more than one person is working on the same document and using a locally installed office application, it may happen that you raise syncronisation conflicts as others have synced a changed the document in the meanwhile. This can be hard to get resolved. When using Office Web Apps, collaborative working is managed by the web application and synchronisation is no longer an issue.

== Prerequisite

* Beside a browser, there is no prerequisite necessary from the user side or any setting to be made in the Desktop App.
* The Infinite Scale instance in the backend needs to have been configured and enabled using Office Web Apps. A configuration can be made by the administrator for multiple or particular office file types. If Office Web Apps are either not configured and enabled for all available or particular office file types, the funtionality is either not available in the context menu at all or only for the configured ones.. Contact your administrator for more details.

The first image shows an Office file via the browser.

btn:[Right click] on the file to open the context menu and click menu:ownCloud[open in ...] to select the application available. Note that the web app shown is the one configured by the admin for this office file type. If menu:open in ...[] is not available, office web apps have either not been enabled y the administrator at all or for this office file type.

A browser window with the web app selected using the file opens. When leaving the Office Web App, the file gets saved on changes automatically.

Note that if multiple persons are accessing the same file via the Office Web App, the Office Web App can show who has opened the file. Depending on the Office Web App, final saving may occur when the last person respectively the last tab of the same person that has accessed the Office Web App closes the Office Web App session/tab which you can see by the changed modification time. Syncing back will only occur after the file got saved.
