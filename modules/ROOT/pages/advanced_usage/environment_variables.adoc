= Environment Variables

== Introduction

The behavior of the client can also be controlled using environment variables.

NOTE: The value of the environment variables override the values in the configuration file.

NOTE: Most environment variables only exist for debugging or testing. They are not officially
supported and may change from version to version. If you end up relying on a setting only available
through an environment variable, please create a bug report.

| Setting
| Default
| Description

| `OWNCLOUD_CHUNK_SIZE`
| 10000000 +
(or 10 MB)
| Specifies the initial chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.
The client will dynamically adjust this size within the maximum and minimum bounds (see below).
To disable chunking completely, set `OWNCLOUD_CHUNK_SIZE=0` .

| `OWNCLOUD_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`
| 100000000 +
(or 100 MB)
| Specifies the maximum chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.

| `OWNCLOUD_MIN_CHUNK_SIZE`
| 1000000 +
(or 1 MB)
| Specifies the minimum chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.

| `OWNCLOUD_TARGET_CHUNK_UPLOAD_DURATION`
| 60000
| Target duration in milliseconds for chunk uploads.
The client adjusts the chunk size until each chunk upload takes approximately this long.
Set to 0 to disable dynamic chunk sizing.

| `OWNCLOUD_CHUNKING_NG`

| `OWNCLOUD_TIMEOUT`
| 300 
| The timeout for network connections in seconds.

| `OWNCLOUD_CRITICAL_FREE_SPACE_BYTES` 
| 50*1000*1000 bytes 
| The minimum disk space needed for operation.
A fatal error is raised if less free space is available.

| `OWNCLOUD_FREE_SPACE_BYTES` 
| 250*1000*1000 bytes 
| Downloads that would reduce the free space below this value are skipped.
More information available under the "Low Disk Space" section.

| `OWNCLOUD_MAX_PARALLEL` 
| 6 
| Maximum number of parallel jobs.

| `OWNCLOUD_BLACKLIST_TIME_MIN` 
| 25 
| Minimum timeout, in seconds, for blacklisted files.

| `OWNCLOUD_BLACKLIST_TIME_MAX` 
| 24*60*60 +

| Maximum timeout, in seconds, for blacklisted files.

| `OWNCLOUD_HTTP2_ENABLED`

| `OWNCLOUD_FULL_LOCAL_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL`
| 3600000 +
(1 hour)
| Maximum time in milliseconds that fast local discovery is allowed for after a full local discovery.
Set to 0 to always require full local discovery.
Set to -1 to never require full local discovery.

| `OWNCLOUD_SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE`
| depends on filesystem
| Set a specific sqlite journal mode.
