== Introduction

IMPORTANT: The values of the environment variables override those in the configuration file.

NOTE: Most environment variables only exist for debugging or testing purposes. They are not officially supported and may change from one version to the next. If you find yourself relying on a setting that is only available through an environment variable, please file a bug report.
