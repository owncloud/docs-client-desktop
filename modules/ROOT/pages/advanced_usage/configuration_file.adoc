= Configuration File
:toc: right
:description: The ownCloud Desktop App uses a configuration file. It has several sections for particular settings. You will find more sections in the configuration file than described here.

:ini-file-format-url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file

== Introduction

{description} Do not change any of those settings except support advises you to do so. 

== Location of the Configuration File
 
The location of the configuration file depends on the operating system used. You can locate this configuration file as follows:

[cols="25%,75%",options="header"]
|===
| System
| Location

| *Linux* 
| `$HOME/.config/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg`
| *Microsoft Windows* 
| `%APPDATA%\ownCloud\owncloud.cfg`
| *macOS* 
|`$HOME/Library/Preferences/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg`
|===

The configuration file contains settings using the {ini-file-format-url}[Microsoft Windows .ini file format]. You can overwrite changes using the ownCloud configuration dialog.

WARNING: Use caution when making changes to the ownCloud Desktop App configuration file. Incorrect settings can produce unintended results.

== Section `[ownCloud]`

See the xref:faq.adoc#clarification-of-terms-used[Clarification of Terms Used] for an in-depth explanation. Note that the default values are always set and used unless you change them.

|===
| Variable
| Default
| Meaning 

| `remotePollInterval` 
| `30000` +
(30s)
| The interval in milliseconds after the last sync the Desktop app polls the server for changes. If not set explicitly via the Desktop app, the Desktop app queries the server if a server-side default is present. 

| `forceSyncInterval` 
| `7200000` +
(2h)
| The interval in milliseconds after which a synchronization is triggered automatically if no regular synchronization activity took place. This enforcement ensures that there is a mandatory synchronization independent of the server's polling response.

| `fullLocalDiscoveryInterval` 
| `3600000` +
(1h)
| The interval in milliseconds after which the Desktop app will perform a full local discovery. Any changes found trigger a synchronization.

| `notificationRefreshInterval` 
| `300000` +
(5min)
| The interval in milliseconds in which the Desktop app checks the server for new notifications.

== Section `[General]`

[width="100%",cols="45%,^25%,100%",options="header"]
|===
| Variable | Default | Meaning 

| `chunkSize` 
| `10000000` +
(or 10 MB)
| Specifies the initial chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.
The Desktop App will dynamically adjust this size within the maximum and minimum bounds (see below).

| `maxChunkSize`
| `100000000` +
(or 100 MB)
| Specifies the maximum chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.

| `minChunkSize`
| `1000000` +
(or 1 MB)
| Specifies the minimum chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.

| `targetChunkUploadDuration`
| `60000` +
(1 minute)
| Target duration in milliseconds for chunk uploads.
The Desktop App adjusts the chunk size until each chunk upload takes approximately this long.
Set to 0 to disable dynamic chunk sizing.

| `promptDeleteAllFiles` 
| `true` 
| If a UI prompt should ask for confirmation if it was detected that all files and folders were deleted.

| `crashReporter`
| `true`
| Whether to show the crash reporter when a crash occurs.

| `timeout`
| `300` 
| The timeout for network connections in seconds. 

| `moveToTrash` 
| `false` 
| If non-locally deleted files should be moved to trash instead of deleting them completely. This option only works on linux 

| `showExperimentalOptions` 
| `false` 
| Whether to show experimental options that are still undergoing testing in the user interface. 
Turning this on does not enable experimental behavior on its own. 
It does enable user interface options that can be used to opt in to experimental features.

== Section `[Proxy]` 

[width="100%",cols="45%,^25%,100%",options="header"]

| The port where the proxy is listening.

| `type` 
| `2`
