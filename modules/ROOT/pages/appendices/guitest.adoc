== Introduction

This document explains how to run GUI tests for the Desktop App locally in your system. To run GUI tests, the Squish GUI Test Automation Tool for all kinds of cross-platform desktop, mobile, embedded and web applications is used.

== Prerequisites

Before we can actually run the test, we will need to build a Desktop App and install and configure Squish first.

NOTE: Before running tests, you need to make sure that you have disabled `oauth2` and `openidconnect` in ownCloud Server.

=== Building the Desktop App

To be able to run tests, you need to xref:appendices/building.adoc[build the Desktop App] from the latest master.

== Prepare Tests

There are two ways to run tests:

* xref:using-squish-ide[Using Squish IDE]
* xref:using-docker[Using Docker]

NOTE: You can use docker or Squish IDE to run the tests but if you want to add new test steps use Squish IDE or any other IDE.

=== Using Squish IDE
* xref:install-squish-ide[Install Squish IDE]
* xref:configure-squish[Configure Squish]

==== Install Squish IDE

After building the ownCloud Desktop App, install and configure Squish. To install Squish, follow these steps:

. Download the latest version of Squish from {squish-url}[froglogic] to a location of your choice.
. Depending upon the version and system you are using, you will get a file like `squish-x.x.x-qtxxx-x64.run`.

NOTE: For desktop client >= 2.11, Squish with QT 5.15 is required.

. Make the downloaded file executable by running the following example command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo chmod +x ./squish-x.x.x-qtxxx-x64.run
----
. Execute the file:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo ./squish-x.x.x-qtxxx-x64.run
----
. You will be asked for a license key. When asked, enter your existing license/url of the license server or get a {free-trial-url}[free trial license]
. After you have entered the license key, Squish opens.

==== Configure Squish

After installing Squish, follow these steps to configure it:

. Close Squish if opened.
. {pythonchanger-url}[Download] the `PythonChanger.py` script and save it in your squish installation folder.
. Run the downloaded script.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo python3 PythonChanger.py --force
----

Some necessary steps before running tests:

. Clone the {client-repo-url}[Desktop App] from GitHub
. Copy `test/gui/config.sample.ini` to `test/gui/config.ini`
. Edit `test/gui/config.ini` and set `BACKEND_HOST=` to the URL of your ownCloud server, e.g. `BACKEND_HOST=http://localhost/owncloud-core`
+
NOTE: *BACKEND_HOST* can be any server, but it is required that the password for the user *admin* is set to *admin*.
+
NOTE: If you are testing against the oCIS server, set *OCIS=true* in the *config.ini*.

. Start Squish
. Open the existing test-suite via: menu:File[Open Test Suite > test/gui]
. Go to menu:Edit[Server Settings > Manage AUTs > Mapped AUTs]
. Click btn:[Add] and select the compiled binary, e.g.: `client/client-build/bin/owncloud`
. Close any running Desktop Apps by clicking btn:[Quit ownCloud] in the settings page
. Run the AUT (Application under Test) to check if everything works properly via menu:Run[Lauch AUT] (the Desktop App settings window should appear)

NOTE: If there are problems with starting Squish, please check the log file `~/.squish/squishlibraryx.log.x`. Also make sure that the `~/squish-for-qt-6.x.x/etc/paths.ini` is user-readable.

=== Using Docker

You can also use the {squish-docker-image-url}[Squish docker image] to run tests. Proceed with the following steps:

. Copy `server.ini` file from `test/gui/drone` to a new folder called `local`
. Change `AUT/owncloud` value to `"/app/client-build/bin"`
. Pull the docker image with the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker pull owncloudci/squish
----

== Run Tests

* xref:run-tests-using-squish[Run Tests Using Squish]
* xref:run-tests-using-docker[Run Tests Using Docker]

NOTE: Before running middleware, install yarn following the instructions from {yarn-install-url}[here] and clone middleware from {owncloud-test-middleware-url}[here].

=== Run Tests Using Squish

* Start the {owncloud-test-middleware-url}[owncloud-test-middleware]
* Quit the Desktop App if you have opened it earlier and make sure that Desktop App is not running in the background.
* Click the play button for a {test-case-scenario-url}[test-case or scenario].

=== Run Tests Using Docker

* Start the {owncloud-test-middleware-url}[owncloud-test-middleware]
* Run the Squish docker image using the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm --network=host -e LICENSEKEY='YOUR_SQUISH_LICENSE' -e MIDDLEWARE_URL='http://localhost:3000/' -e BACKEND_HOST='http://localhost/owncloud-server/' -e SERVER_INI='/app/test/gui/local/server.ini' -e CLIENT_REPO='/app/' -e SQUISH_PARAMETERS='--retry 1' -v ${PWD}:/app owncloudci/squish:latest
----

== Create New Steps

* The language used for the tests is basically the same as in other repos. See {acceptance-tests-url}[how to write acceptance tests] for more information.
* Steps that have to go through the test-middleware are named the same way they are named in the {stepdefinitions-url}[middleware] but have additionally `on the server` either at the end or in the middle of the sentence.

== Object Identification

See {object-map-object-url}[object mapping and identification] for more details.
