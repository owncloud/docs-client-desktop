== Introduction

{description}

== Removing the Binary

Follow the procedures of your operating system about how to remove the Desktop App binary.

When using an AppImage, just delete the AppImage file.

== Removing the Configuration File

When you remove the Desktop App -- the configuration file remains on your system. If you then decide to install the client again, you won't need to re-enter the connection information.
 
In case you want a clean removal of the Desktop App, you manually have to delete the configuration file. The location of the configuration file is operating system dependent and can be found in the
xref:advanced_usage/configuration_file.adoc[Configuration File] description.

== Windows Navigation Sidebar

If you have removed the Desktop App but still have the ownCloud shortcut or symbol in the Windows Navigation Side Bar, here is how you to remove it:

1. Open `regedit`. (press the Windows Key and type regedit)
2. Search (CTL+F) for the name of the Desktop App, in this case `owncloud`.
3. Press `F3` for next search result.
4. Look for the key `System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree`.
5. Right-click on the key name, change, set to `0` instead of `1`.

You have to do this twice. Once for the `x64` and `x32` system settings.

Once this is done, you don't need a reboot, just open and close your explorer -- the sidebar is clean.
